The big ongoing change to the library is converting most code
implementation from C++ to C, leaving only C++ wrappers.

- All old C functions are prefixed with lx.

- All converted C functions, macros and constants are
  prefixed with lx.

- lx prefix: anything that should stay in C++

- lx prefix: everything that is C-only
